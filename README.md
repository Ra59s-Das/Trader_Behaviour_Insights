# 📊 Trader Behaviour Insights

A data analysis project exploring how trader sentiment influences trading outcomes and market activity.  
This project combines Python data processing and Power BI visualization to reveal behavioral trading patterns.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize **how market sentiment impacts trader decisions** — such as profitability, trade volume, and activity level.

Using the combined dataset of trader performance and market sentiment, insights were drawn through:
- Python-based data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Statistical summaries and CSV outputs  
- Interactive dashboards built in Power BI  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Higher *Greed* sentiment often corresponds to **lower average profitability**.
- *Fear* periods show **reduced trade volume** but more cautious decision-making.
- *Neutral* sentiment shows the **most stable trading behavior**.
